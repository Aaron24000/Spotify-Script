# Spotify-Script
Growing up, I've always played the FIFA games. The best part for me is the soundtrack. I have playlists that contain songs from the last 10 FIFAs, so I have created a script to take all songs from the 10 playlists and make it into one master playlist! This was also to help me learn python functions, reading docs, using git, etc.
